# JavaScript DOMController Boilerplate

A basic boilerplate for controlling your page. This DOMController Object is intended to provide structure to your event binds and basic page interaction. It is compatible with dependency systems like RequireJS and CommonJS, but operates just fine without them. While the DOMController Object is intended to operate as a singleton Object, it is written in a manner that it could be instantiated multiple times.

## Dependencies

This project uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)

## Files in this Repo

##### `main-documented.js`

This is the heavily documented version of the DOMController Boilerplate and should probably only used for reference.

##### `main.js`

If you wish to use this file in your own project, base it off this file. It contains the minimal documentation for use and operation and has some of the example code found in `main-documented.js` removed.
